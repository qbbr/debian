wmname - prints/sets the WM name
================================
Prints/sets the EWMH WM name property.


Requirements
------------
In order to build wmname you need the Xlib header files.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (wmname is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install wmname
(if necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running wmname
--------------
Run 'wmname' to print the current WM name. Run 'wmname <name>' to set it. This
is pretty much similiar to hostname(1).
